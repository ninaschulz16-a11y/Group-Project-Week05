SolSet app

An app to be used by people who enjoy photography and travelling to specific places for a change of taking photos.

Search the name of a city and the app will show you :

-Local current weather
-Some landmarks attached to that city accompanied by pictures of said landmarks( for an idea of how you explore the place in photografic terms)

It was made to help photography enthusiasts to plan their visit, knowing what to prepare for in certain weather conditions.

It features:

*A search form that allows you to search a city by name.
*It works both on mobile and desktop.
*To check for live local weather (such as temperature, sun rise and sun set times, and weather conditions)
*Show a list of images of famous landmarks, popular for their photogenic features. 

To develop this app we used:

  Backend: 

-Node.js and Express
-database : supabase (PostgreSQL) - also used Unsplash for the landmarks' images URLs.
-API : OpenWeather (https://openweathermap.org/) 

  Frontend:

-HTML
